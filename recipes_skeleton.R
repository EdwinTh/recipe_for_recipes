#' `step_<name>` creates a *specification* of a recipe
#'  step that will <your text here>
#'
#' @param recipe A recipe object. The step will be added to the
#'  sequence of operations for this recipe.
#' @param ... One or more selector functions to choose which
#'  variables are affected by the step. See [selections()]
#'  for more details. For the `tidy` method, these are not
#'  currently used.
#' @param role Not used by this step since no new variables are
#'  created.
#' @param skip A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
#'  recipe is baked by [bake.recipe()]? While all operations are baked
#'  when [prep.recipe()] is run, some operations may not be able to be
#'  conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
#'  Care should be taken when using `skip = TRUE` as it may affect
#'  the computations for subsequent operations
#'  <extra arguments to your step>
#' @return An updated version of `recipe` with the new step
#'  added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
#'  `tidy` method, a tibble with columns `terms` (the
#'  selectors or variables selected) and `value` (the means).
